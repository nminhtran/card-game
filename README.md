Have some cards with numbers(from 3 to 1000) 
Choose any cards (except the first and the last)
The score = (number in choosen card) * (number in a card before choose card  +  number in a card after choose card)
Finish when only have 2 card and find the highest score
Eg: Cards : 3 4 6 => Score = 4*(3+6)
